Cystic Fibrosis, a genetic disorder, disrupts the body’s salt and water balance, creating thick mucus in the lungs. _Pneumonia_ infects the alveoli and can be bacterial or viral, including strains like the one responsible for COVID-19. _Tuberculosis_ is a bacterial lung infection with symptoms akin to pneumonia. _PulmonaryEdema_ involves fluid accumulation in the lung’s air sacs, often due to heart failure or lung injury. Lung Cancer may develop in any lung area, frequently linked to smoking or pollutants like radon and asbestos. Lastly, Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a grave, rapid-onset lung injury from severe illnesses, including COVID-19. Each of these conditions highlights the lungs’ vulnerability to a spectrum of harmful factors.")
